# Task T007 / Subtask S001 — Define GitHub Issue Planning Model

## Objective
Design a lightweight yet explicit model for representing llm-agent-dock tasks as GitHub issues, including metadata, labels, and linking strategy back to repo docs.

## Deliverables
- Draft GitHub issue template (or updates to existing templates) capturing task context, plan links, and status fields.
- Proposed label taxonomy / naming conventions for tracking task lifecycle.
- Documentation of how local task folders reference the canonical GitHub issue without duplicating content.
- Updated plan checklist + Feedback section.

## Flow
1. Review current task docs plus GitHub issue templates/labels in the repo or org.
2. Identify required metadata fields (status, owner, links) and draft template + label mapping.
3. Document linking policy between GitHub issues and local `doc/ai/tasks/T###_*` folders.
4. Record decisions + open questions in this subtask’s Feedback.
5. Commit `T007/S001: define github issue model` once checklist items are complete.
