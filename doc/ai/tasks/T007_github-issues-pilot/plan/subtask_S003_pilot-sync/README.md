# Task T007 / Subtask S003 — Run Pilot Issue + Link Local Docs

## Objective
Create the GitHub issue representing T007, align local docs to reference it, and demonstrate the end-to-end sync workflow (status, feedback, and fallbacks).

## Deliverables
- A live GitHub issue for T007 populated with the template from S001.
- Updates to `doc/ai/tasks/README.md` and `doc/ai/tasks/T007_github-issues-pilot/README.md` pointing to the issue as canonical scope.
- Documented process for keeping GitHub and repo plan files synchronized (including offline notes).
- Updated plan checklist + Feedback summary of the pilot run.

## Flow
1. Using the template from S001, open the T007 GitHub issue (or convert existing task doc into issue form) and capture its URL.
2. Update local task README + index to mark T007 as Active and link to the GitHub issue + plan folder.
3. Describe sync cadence (status fields, progress log mirrors, offline fallback) in the task README or plan as appropriate.
4. Record observations, blockers, or future improvements in Feedback.
5. Commit `T007/S003: wire pilot gh issue sync` after verifying checklist completion.
