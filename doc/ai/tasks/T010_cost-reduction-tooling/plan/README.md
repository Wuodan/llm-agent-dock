# Task T010 — Cost Reduction Tooling Analysis

Last updated: 2025-11-08T17:51Z by Codex

## Context
- Building on T008/T009, we want to explore concrete tools/processes that can reduce token usage (e.g., MCP wrappers, alternate models, automation for high-cost steps).
- Task C remains intentionally high-level until we finish Tasks A/B, but we can scaffold the plan so ideas can flow in as they surface.

## GitHub Issue
- Not yet created; wait until Task A/B insights are captured.

## Workflow Guardrails
1. Pull inputs from T008 (cost audit) and T009 (template needs) before finalizing scope.
2. Focus on analysis + recommendations; implementation tasks will likely spin off into future task IDs.

## Subtask Placeholder
_(To be defined once we complete T008/T009)_

## Progress Log (T010)
- 2025-11-08T17:51Z — Placeholder plan created to capture future ideas.

## References
- T008 workflow cost audit (upcoming).
- T009 template requirements.

## Notes
- Update this plan after Tasks A/B finish so Task C scope reflects the latest insights.
