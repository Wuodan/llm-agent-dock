# Task T010 — Cost Reduction Tooling Analysis

## Status
- Status: Draft (will activate after T008/T009 results)
- Owner: TBD
- Links: `doc/ai/tasks/T010_cost-reduction-tooling/plan/README.md`

## Background
As token usage pressure grows, we want to analyze tooling options (MCP wrappers, cheaper models, automation) that could reduce cost without harming quality. This task depends on insights from T008 (cost tracking) and T009 (template needs).

## Goals & Deliverables (tentative)
1. Review workflow steps and identify candidates for automation/offloading.
2. Explore MCP-based wrappers or external tools (e.g., run lower-cost models for certain actions).
3. Produce recommendations + prioritized follow-up tasks.

## Next Steps
- Finish T008/T009, then flesh out detailed subtasks here.
