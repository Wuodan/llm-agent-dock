# Task T008 / Subtask S004 — Draft Workflow Cost Audit Doc

## Objective
Create `doc/ai/workflow/workflow_cost_audit.md`, summarizing the current workflow steps, their expected token/time footprint, and candidates for future optimization (input to Task C).

## Deliverables
- New audit document with sections for planning, branching, documentation, reviews, etc.
- Qualitative or quantitative cost estimates per step (even if rough).
- Highlighted “potential savings” list feeding into future tasks.
- Updated checklist + Feedback notes.

## Flow
1. Enumerate major workflow steps from `AGENTS.md`, plan templates, and observed practice.
2. For each, estimate relative token usage/time (e.g., Low/Med/High, or bucket ranges if available).
3. Capture notes about tooling/offload ideas to revisit in Task C.
4. Store the doc at `doc/ai/workflow/workflow_cost_audit.md` and link it from T008 plan.
5. Commit `T008/S004: publish workflow cost audit` after checklist completion.

## Checklist
- [ ] Workflow steps cataloged.
- [ ] Cost/complexity estimates recorded.
- [ ] Potential savings/opportunities listed.
- [ ] Feedback updated.
- [ ] Commit `T008/S004: publish workflow cost audit`.

## Inputs & References
- `AGENTS.md`
- Observed workflow from T007.

## Exit Criteria
- Audit doc ready for future refinement (Task C) and referenced in AGENTS/guides as needed.
